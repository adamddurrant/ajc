				<![CDATA[<p>When Buddy Hill ran his first campaign for solicitor general in Chattooga County, local officials did a double-take as he lined up to qualify for office as a Republican.</p><p>Back then, the county’s leadership was dominated by conservative Democrats, and Hill’s 2012 victory became a watershed moment for local Republicans. It was the first time in recent memory a GOP contender won a countywide race in Chattooga.</p><p>As Hill prepares to compete for another term, though, he’s ready to wage a legal battle against the local Republican Party that once feted him, outraged at new rules that govern which candidates can run on the ballot with an “R” by their name.</p><p>“If they decide I’m not Republican enough and they try to disqualify me from running, I’ll fight it. It’s just not right,” Hill said. “It denies the voters their power to elect who they want.”</p><p>It’s not an idle concern. GOP committees in Chattooga County and nearby Pickens County have adopted rules that give party leaders the final say on whether candidates for county office are eligible to run as Republicans.</p><p>It’s a miniature version of a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-proposed-rule-change-deepens-rift-among-georgia-republicans/WJRAW7VNNBEHLMSPGEPJSNXATU/" target="_blank">failed statewide effort by hardline conservatives</a> to pass rules that could have blocked state candidates from qualifying as Republicans if they’re deemed to be insufficiently conservative.</p><p>Pickens County Republicans adopted the so-called “accountability” platform in August with little outcry. There’s been far more backlash in Chattooga County, another GOP safe haven where Gov. Brian Kemp captured 84% of the vote in last year’s midterm.</p><p>Chattooga County GOP chair Jennifer Tudor said the rule requires candidates to earn the blessing of a five-member committee to run as a Republican for countywide offices, though it can’t reject contenders for state or federal seats from running on the party’s ballot.</p><p>“Should we be forced to accept a candidate who claims to be Republican but supports abortion, gun control, big government and high taxes?” asked Tudor, who added: “Deceptive politicians should not be allowed to take advantage of poor, low information voters.”</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/n7UFuTayTnkEqIqvH9xZhJ-BgUY=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/EZQVZY4BSBCTXFGQSKHVZ5FKYM.jpeg" alt="Chattooga County Commissioner Blake Elsberry." height="600" width="1000"/><p>Critics say the system disenfranchises primary voters who often decide the victors in heavily Republican counties. Among the opponents is <a href="https://www.andyallenforcommissioner.com/" target="_blank">Andy Allen</a>, who recently announced he would challenge Blake Elsberry, the county’s powerful sole commissioner.</p><p>A newcomer to politics, Allen calls himself a “true conservative Republican” but said he fears he’ll be disqualified by party leaders who want to protect Elsberry and other incumbents.</p><p>“My concern is that a panel of five people would have influence over who is elected in a county of 25,000 people,” said Allen, who is considering taking legal action to oppose the rule. “I think that’s all sorts of wrong.”</p><h1>‘A traitor’</h1><p>The local overhauls echo a proposal championed by the Georgia Republican Assembly, a conservative faction that has vilified Kemp and other state incumbents who rejected then-President Donald Trump’s demands to illegally overturn his defeat in 2020.</p><p>They tried to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/far-right-faction-pushes-to-oust-traitors-from-georgia-gop/2ADAPHD5ZBB3FIKFXQ2LWPH4P4/" target="_blank">force a vote </a>at the Georgia GOP convention earlier this year that would have given the state party’s roughly 1,500 delegates the authority to decide who was eligible to run as a Republican in top races.</p><p>“If the candidate has shown himself to be a traitor to the principles of the party, then the party can vote to exclude him from qualifying at the next election,” was how <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-anti-abortion-leader-faces-backlash-for-jab-at-late-house-speaker/253SUXLQMJDRJBMKB2GVEF7T6E/">Nathaniel Darnell</a>, a GRA leader, explained the proposal to supporters earlier this year.</p><p>It was sidelined by a coalition of far-right activists and mainstream conservatives who issued dire warnings that it would shift significant power from voters to the state party, which has been riven by internal fissures.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/nQM5HO5DLFUEWUAvQ0XHNj-_Pvs=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/FASRGFJQDL64VONWKSOKVOXPCU.jpg" alt="Nathaniel Darnell, the Georgia director for the National Federation of Republican Assemblies, speaks during the Georgia March for Life rally Friday, Jan. 20, 2023, at Liberty Plaza in Atlanta. (Jason Getz/The Atlanta Journal-Constitution/TNS)" height="600" width="1000"/><p>Some of the most intense opposition was driven by Trump loyalists who warned the change could come back to haunt them if moderate Republicans win control of grassroots party infrastructure in the future.</p><p>“I believe in the power of the ballot box. I believe that GOP primary voters should decide who they want as their nominee,” said Debbie Dooley, a former Tea Party leader. “A small group of activists shouldn’t decide it.”</p><h1>‘It seems idiotic’</h1><p>It’s unclear if the new local party rules run afoul of state or federal law. Alex Johnson, the GRA president, said there is legal precedence for the policies, including the Wyoming GOP’s decision to oust then-U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney from the party. Opponents say they are bound to be rejected in court or circumvented by the Legislature. </p><p>Nor is it apparent how broadly the so-called “accountability” initiatives will spread. Georgia GOP officials, who have not taken a public stance on the local overhauls, say Chattooga and Pickens are likely the only two counties in the state that have so far adopted the rules.</p><p>Pickens County GOP Chairman Christopher Mora said local Republicans weren’t out to start a trend when they voted in August to authorize a group of roughly 32 party officials to vet each candidate’s eligibility to run as a Republican.</p><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=CMGA6783024788" width="100%"></iframe></p><p>“We were concerned about having to accept just any old person willing to show up with a check and sign the oath,” said Mora. “It seems idiotic.”</p><p>The committee hasn’t disqualified any contender yet, though that could change when it meets in January. Those who are rejected can still run as Democratic or independent candidates, he said.</p><p>“This isn’t some purity test. We’re just trying to stop Democrats running as Republicans,” Mora added. “The majority of the county is Republican, and we want to make sure the people that are running it are actually conservatives.”</p><h1>‘Common sense?’</h1><p>In nearby Chattooga, a political shift is underway. Conservative Democrats who held key county posts have <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/facebook-post-triggers-democratic-revolt-northwest-georgia-county/vZzsNBz7vWIxRZZ7ZC2UtN/">either retired or joined the GOP in recent years</a>, including four office-holders who became Republicans in 2019.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/BP7XK05pHIyBDCUMRVBRs1JZdBs=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/6GF5RFSAEBCJBJNIBCIODAEHEQ.jpg" alt="Chattooga Democrats exit party after social media backlash" height="600" width="1000"/><p>But local activists say the loyalties of the party-switchers aren’t in question. Instead, they say they’re more dubious of political newcomers without long track records in public office. Tudor, the county GOP chair, compared the vetting process to a job application.</p><p>“They make decisions on what happens to tax money taken from you. In many cases they have the ability to create or vote on laws that can possibly change your lives,” she said. “It’s really common sense.”</p><p>To Allen, the commission candidate, it’s a blatant power grab. He said that the sinister nature of the new rules became obvious when Tudor and other party leaders announced them just hours after he filed paperwork to challenge Elsberry. (Tudor said the timing was a coincidence.)</p><p>“I’m about as conservative as they get,” said Allen. “This isn’t about that. They’re trying to infringe on voters’ rights. They just want to protect incumbents.”</p><p><br/></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>A fire overnight under a bridge on Cheshire Bridge Road has closed the thoroughfare in both directions early Wednesday morning.</p><p>The fire was reported near Faulkner Road around 1 a.m., according to Channel 2 Action News. It is not the same bridge where another fire broke out in 2021 and left it closed for over a year, but it is about a quarter mile from there.</p><p>Wednesday’s fire was contained by 4 a.m., authorities told Channel 2. Police remain at the scene to block traffic as investigators and inspectors continue their work.</p><p>It is not clear what caused the fire or if any injuries were reported, and there is no timetable for when the road might reopen.</p><p>Commuters can use Piedmont or Lenox roads as alternates.</p><p>— Please return to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution for updates.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/republican-move-to-investigate-raffensperger-over-2020-falls-short/PADBZBA7CZAUBAZCGKEQT75BC4/" target="_blank">managed to avoid</a>&nbsp;a formal investigation by the State Election Board into his actions during the 2020 election, but<b></b>his top deputy is seething that an effort by conservative activists and election skeptics almost succeeded. Two of the board’s four members embraced the calls and voted in favor of a probe during a Tuesday meeting.</p><p>“The election wasn’t stolen and our office is surprised to see particular members of the State Election Board laying the foundation to discredit the next election,” Jordan Fuchs told the AJC.</p><p>“Once again, we don’t cater to election deniers and we will continue to focus on a smooth, secure and accurate 2024 election,” she added. “We urge others to do the same.”</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/5ldr2uvSQAbP_G6F-btRVFzOWYU=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/Y4UP6RPNO5CBEFDXHAULIQ3QOM.JPG" alt="The State Election Board meets at the Capitol in Atlanta on Tuesday, December 19, 2023. Pictured, left to right: Edward Lindsey, Matthew Mashburn and Janice Johnston. (Arvin Temkar/arvin.temkar@ajc.com)" height="600" width="1000"/><p>The board fell one vote short of the majority needed to launch an investigation.

The Georgia GOP is a frequent critic of Raffensperger and is led by Republicans who <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-gop-elects-election-deniers-to-key-posts/7QJTDJUCLZDLTNOTAF7GH6JFQA/" target="_blank">question the results of the 2020 election</a>&nbsp;and promote conspiracy theories.</p><p>But the “yes” vote by Lindsey, a mainstream Republican, turned heads. Lindsey said his vote was a way to hold the office accountable.</p><p>“Today’s discussion was not on the merits of any particular claim against the secretary of state or the allegations about the 2020 election but simply whether the State Election Board has jurisdiction to hear any complaints on any subject against his office,” he said. “The vote today now sends this jurisdictional question to the General Assembly.”</p><p>As a reminder about the 2020 election: Three vote counts confirmed that Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump by about 12,000 votes in Georgia, and multiple <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/no-counterfeit-ballots-found-by-georgia-election-investigators/OFRHJDGKOJH7BMKCH77VMR63NM/" target="_blank">investigations </a>have <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/alleged-dead-georgia-voters-found-alive-and-well-after-2020-election/DAL3VY7NFNHL5OREMHD7QECOCA/" target="_blank">debunked</a>&nbsp;allegations of widespread voter <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-investigation-dispels-allegations-highlighted-in-2000-mules/DREWO27XXBF7PB4DGTBXWGQYV4/" target="_blank">fraud</a>.</p><p>***</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/hZF_54LhWiJvZWesXZvrpY-Ynes=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/RWLNP23ULFALJKZNT23SXXZ6V4.JPG" alt="The House Reapportionment and Redistricting committee meet for a hearing at the Georgia State Capitol on Tuesday, December 5, 2023.District Judge Steve Jones hears arguments today on whether Republican lawmakers complied with his order to draw new majority-Black legislative and congressional districts.

				<![CDATA[<p>U.S. District Judge Steve Jones will preside over a hearing on Wednesday that will determine if the new GOP-drawn political districts can be used in the 2024 elections.</p><p>In October, Jones ruled that districts passed in 2021 violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by illegally diluting Black voting power and tasked them with creating seven new majority-Black legislative districts and one new majority-Black congressional district.</p><p>Jones’ order required legislators to create an additional majority-Black congressional district in west metro Atlanta by Dec. 8. He also called for two more state Senate districts and five more state House districts with Black majorities in the Atlanta and Macon areas.</p><p>Gov. Brian Kemp signed the new maps into law on Dec. 8.</p><p>Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and other Black voters and organizations say the Republican-drawn maps fall short of the judge’s order because they move voters around in a way that still denies Black voters representation. Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically Black fraternity that’s been active in civil rights causes, and other plaintiffs successfully sued the state over the 2021 maps.</p><p>Attorneys for the state say the General Assembly followed Jones’ orde.</p><p>Below are some of the arguments attorneys are likely to make during Wednesday’s hearing.</p><p><b>Alpha Phi Alpha, et. al. — plaintiffs</b></p><p>In court filings, attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that state lawmakers changed districts outside of the “affected area” — meaning those in districts that were found to violate the Voting Rights Act — in addition to the districts identified by Jones.</p><p>Jones ruled in October that five congressional, 10 state Senate and 11 state House districts violated the law. The approved maps altered 11 congressional districts, 15 state Senate and 57 in the House.</p><p>In doing so, attorneys said, lawmakers created the new majority-Black districts by shifting district lines in areas where there already were majority-Black districts.</p><p>In his order, Jones said lawmakers could not eliminate any existing “minority opportunity districts,” generally <a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/wp-content/uploads/Basics-English10.pdf">defined</a> as areas where racial minority groups are able to elect their preferred candidates by attracting some support from white voters. They also could not eliminate any existing majority-Black districts.</p><p>But attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that the state “dismantled” a “minority opportunity” district with changes to Congressional District 7, currently represented by U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath. Nonwhite voters make up a majority of the population in that district but no one race makes a majority.</p><p><b>Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — defendant</b></p><p>Attorneys representing the state say they followed the judge’s order by creating seven new majority-Black legislative districts and one new majority-Black congressional district.</p><p>Attorneys say lawmakers were not required to only amend the districts identified in Jones’ order. Instead, they said, affected voters needed to only live in the region that was identified by the court.</p><p>They also argue that they did not eliminate any “minority opportunity districts” because the term is undefined in Jones’ order. The state said it interpreted “minority opportunity districts” as majority-Black districts.</p><p>The question of whether multiracial coalition districts are covered by the Voting Rights Act is unsettled among appellate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court. The state argues that federal law does not protect “crossover districts,” also called “opportunity districts.”</p><p><b>Details on the hearing</b></p><p>Jones will hear testimony from three groups of plaintiffs who are challenging the maps.</p><p>The hearing will begin at  9 a.m. at the Richard B. Russell Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Atlanta,</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p><i>This story was originally published by </i><a href="https://www.artsatl.org/atlanta-filmmakers-turn-shoestring-budget-into-feel-good-holiday-film/"><i>ArtsATL</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><i>“</i>Christmas with Jerks<i>”</i> has a holiday film plot if you ever heard one: Eve Carter (Leanna Adams), a former child star with a penchant for cocktails, is thrilled to be spending Christmas alone at her sister’s house. Imagine her displeasure when the house turns out to be occupied by professional stuntman Ace Strong (Tyler Buckingham), who is dog-sitting while he recovers from a foot injury. Stuck in a stalemate, the hostile parties try their best to kick each other to the curb — unless they fall in love first.</p><p>As a screenplay idea, “enemies-turned-lovebirds stuck inside a house” had all the hallmarks of a cozy holiday movie. But for Adams, who wrote and starred in <a href="https://gooddeedentertainment.com/christmas-with-jerks/">“Christmas with Jerks,”</a> it had another enormous appeal: She could film almost all of it in a single location.</p><p>“I mean, I love movies with lots of baby goats, and I love movies with kids!” Adams said. “But writing it a little smaller just made the whole thing possible.”</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/UMSmSO5qW9ue6yqU1zLf_U4vwsk=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/FH5YI3DICJBBLCHYSMKH2E5YEA.jpg" alt="“Christmas with Jerks” co-directors and co-producers Leanna Adams (left) and Kristina Arjona." height="600" width="1000"/><p>It was late 2022, and the Atlanta writer and actor was feeling discouraged. Adams, who has appeared recently in shows such as “The Staircase” and “Shift Drinks,” had come close to selling several pilot scripts and features to film studios, but nothing had worked out. “I just really wanted to work,” she said. “I wanted to learn from the process of script to screen.”</p><p>Rather than wait for the next opportunity, Adams decided to create her own. She wrote the script for “Christmas with Jerks” in a matter of weeks, inspired by her life experience as an actor struggling with self-doubt and insecurity. “I’m not a former child star,” she said. “But I have felt this career desperation and frustration, and I really channeled that into this story.”</p><p>She set the film at her actual sister’s house in Avondale Estates, a beautiful modern home that has served as a location for multiple local productions. “I knew I could con her into it,” Adams joked.</p><p>At first, she planned to barrel into the production all on her own. “I said, I’ll just do it all myself — I’ll get a computer and teach myself to edit,” she laughed. “That was pretty delusional.”</p><p>Instead, Adams turned to her local film community to see if anyone might be willing to help her make her movie. As it turned out, they were more than willing.</p><p>Kristina Arjona, who co-directed and co-produced “Christmas with Jerks,” originally came on in a crew role. The pair know each other from Atlanta’s indie film scene; in 2014, they won the 48 Hour Film Festival together and have since overlapped on projects around town. In recent years, Arjona has cultivated a successful career in the growing field of intimacy coordination, where a trained professional works closely with actors performing sensual or sexual scenes to protect their safety and comfort.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/Mi2xOuM0nZYuT_fgpWM-RRj908g=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/XAZQKXGF2FDKFJIGMIZEZHHH4A.JPG" alt="Co-Directors Leanna Adams, left, and Kristina Arjona on the set of “Christmas with Jerks.”" height="600" width="1000"/><p>When Adams approached Arjona about joining “Christmas with Jerks” as intimacy coordinator in February 2023, she mentioned that she was also looking for a co-director. It turned out to be good timing: Filming was slowing down as studios braced for the imminent writers’ strike, and Arjona’s schedule had cleared up. “Suddenly I had two months that were really empty,” Arjona said. “So, I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s do this!’”</p><p>They assembled a small cast and crew and scheduled shooting for late April to coincide with the spring break of Adams’ 8-year-old son. “I said, ‘I can make films, or I can be a mom — I can’t do both,”’ Adams recalled.</p><p>Her son went to his grandparents’ house in Colorado, and Adams and Arjona shot the film in eight days. Their editors and music composers finished post-production over the summer, and, by mid-August, they had secured a distributor, Good Deeds Entertainment. It was released to streaming in November, barely a year after Adams had finished the script. “We didn’t sleep much,” said Arjona with a laugh.</p><p>It was a breakneck pace to produce a film, but the filmmakers agree that the learning experience was worth it.</p><p>“It all can feel so overwhelming,” Arjona said. “You know how to make the film, but then how do you sell it and get it onto a streaming site? There’s no tangible explanation for that.”</p><p>The average budget for a feature film made in Georgia is $41.7 million, according to a 2021 report by TAG Media &amp; Entertainment. Even low-budget features can require deep pockets — for reference, the Screen Actors Guild classifies “ultra-low budget” as any film that costs under $300,000. Adams and Arjona had less than that — a lot less.</p><p>What they had instead were friends, family, colleagues and local business owners, all of whom wanted a local indie to succeed. “We pulled out all the favors, every last one,” Adams said.</p><p>Friends pitched in their services as cast and crew, and some novice crew members joined to gain on-the-job experience. A friend from the comedy scene baked an on-screen birthday cake; another did the logo. Equipment companies rented them cameras and mics at a discount, and local food and drink purveyors such Twain’s and Banjo Coffee donated meals for the cast and crew. They even partnered with Topo Chico for branded sponsorship.</p><p>“It was more work logistically than just having one big donor, but it made it more accessible,” Arjona explained, “especially for our community that wanted to help us but didn’t have a ton of money.” Relying on the community for in-kind donations allowed precious funds to go toward essentials such as professional post-production work and licensing extra music.</p><p>“Christmas with Jerks” was <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/christmas-with-jerks/umc.cmc.374537s3u7va66s3hk8kl6elx">released on AppleTV+</a> in time for the holiday season, and the filmmakers are already planning their next production, a vampire comedy set in a movie theater. “It’s still shooting in one location, but we’ll need a way bigger budget for blood,” Arjona joked.</p><p>With a feature film already under their belt, it’s been easier to connect with potential producers in Atlanta and Los Angeles. That’s further confirmation for the duo that their DIY approach, despite the hurdles, pays off in the long run. They both feel that Atlanta, with its supportive film community eager to see fellow creatives succeed, is the right place to try new things.</p><p>“In the very beginning, I said, I want to make a movie, but how can I not fail?” Adams said. “And I realized if the goal is learning, you can’t fail. Then you’ve made something, and you’re proud of it.”</p><h2>WHERE TO WATCH</h2><p><b>“Christmas with Jerks”</b>&nbsp;on <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/christmas-with-jerks/umc.cmc.374537s3u7va66s3hk8kl6elx">AppleTV+</a></p><p>::</p><p><a href="https://www.artsatl.org/author/rachel-garbus/"><i>Rachel Garbus</i></a><i> is a writer, editor and oral history maker in Atlanta.

				<![CDATA[<p>As my eight-year run as mayor of Brookhaven comes to an end, I look back in amazement at the area’s transformation since officially becoming a city a little more than 10 years ago.</p><p>Located just outside of the City of Atlanta, Brookhaven shines as a wellspring of diversity where technology and innovation converge to meet community needs. We watch our citizens come together, supporting each other and this place we call home. This is all a direct result of Brookhaven’s transition to city status.</p><p>And believe it or not, I had originally voted against it.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/p-PRIWXtzzDLltj3Mex5Q9pJ-l8=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/W3FESQGBRJGHNPYPCJ4BFYMEWU.jpg" alt="John Ernst" height="600" width="1000"/><p>That opinion came after listening to many discussions about how the balkanization of metro Atlanta would bring about negative consequences. I assumed a bundle of individual cities would be a resounding chorus of “no, no, no” to larger, regional issues, halting any true sense of progress, and increasing our taxes. Additionally, I thought Brookhaven’s cityhood wouldn’t benefit our already underserved Hispanic population, furthering racial divides.</p><p>However, I knew at the core that good government still exists, which led me to change my mind, run for mayor and attempt to do something about it. Soon after entering office, my previous opinion proved wrong as myself and other local mayors united as a communal think tank to come up with solutions to challenges facing the greater region.</p><p>In Brookhaven proper, we were able to quickly build a city government that listens to the desires of the population and fosters change for all, while keeping the lowest millage rate in the county.</p><p>Among the items at the top of the list were public spaces and infrastructure. We have reimagined and sustained our historic and beautiful parks, including Ashford Park and the Peachtree Creek Greenway. The latter is a multimodal path that currently stretches 1.3 miles from North Druid Hills Road to Briarwood Road, and it will eventually connect Atlanta, Brookhaven, Chamblee, Unincorporated DeKalb County, and Doraville.</p><p>Our crowning achievement will be the Brookhaven City Hall/City Centre project, which broke ground in early October and will serve as the anchor of our municipality. A state of the art city hall will be the centerpiece, housing government offices and extensive space for public meetings, gatherings and special events. Master plans for the City Centre concepts include mixed-use, retail, and residential development, a large public green space and additional paths and multiuse trails leading to the site, all funded without residential taxes.</p><p>The City Hall/City Centre district will take Brookhaven’s already robust community engagement to new heights while turbocharging our economy. Currently, our Brookhaven Cherry Blossom Festival is one of the larger music festivals in the state, with approximately 45,000 guests in 2023. We recently debuted our inaugural Brookhaven International Festival, celebrating the breadth of cultures in our city, and our Light Up Brookhaven holiday event was earlier this month. These and other special events overflow the city calendar, nurturing local spirit.</p><p>And my former self would be amazed at the tax cuts we have been able to provide homesteaded property owners over the past four years while continuing to deliver efficient city services and purchasing more than 41% more parks and greenspaces, all financed without residential taxpayer funds through innovative funding mechanisms, like allowing the state-mandated hotel/motel tax to be used for building the Peachtree Creek Greenway.</p><p>Enhancing and increasing public safety measures in Brookhaven was paramount throughout my tenure as mayor. One of our successes continues to be the license plate reader program. Brookhaven blazed a trail with this initiative, becoming the first city in the state to implement license plate readers throughout. Each time a vehicle enters and exits certain parts of the city, the license plate is identified, which totals nearly 4 million license plates per month.</p><p>Prior to utilizing license plate readers, we would recover approximately three stolen vehicles per year. In the first month of use, we recovered 12 vehicles and those numbers remain impressive.</p><p>Due to the fact many criminals steal cars to commit other crimes, we’re literally stopping crime before it happens. On top of that, the technology allows us to squash sex offenders, identify stalkers, respond to Amber Alerts and more.</p><p>Brookhaven’s live 911 call program is another resource amping up our city policing. When 911 dispatch receives a call, it also goes directly to a police officer patrolling the area where the call originates. At that point, the officer can determine if the call demands immediate action. This often results in negative response times with officers arriving on the scene less than a minute after a call comes in. Everything from bank fraud to burglary to murder has been stopped in its tracks thanks to live 911 calls. This will soon be bolstered by our drone program, which will be able to send a police drone to any part of the city within 45 seconds.</p><p>While the end of my two terms as mayor of Brookhaven personally proves to be bittersweet, I’m proud to say the foundation for the city has been set. I’m eagerly looking forward to experiencing and enjoying all Brookhaven has and will become. Most importantly, I hope to use it as an opportunity to remind others to challenge their assumptions and be the change they want to see.</p><p><i>John Ernst is Brookhaven’s mayor.</i></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p><b>Trump wants to be dictator for life, not just one day</b></p><p>Donald Trump has admitted that he would be a dictator on only his first day in office. His top goal is to get retribution on anyone he perceives as his enemy, which includes anyone who disagrees with him. He will have deportation raids, a Muslim ban and mass firings.</p><p>Trump wants to abolish the U.S. Department of Education but influence local school districts. He wants a stop-and-frisk policy by police across the country — a violation of the 4th Amendment.</p><p>As a deterrent, he wants the cops to have the power to shoot shoplifters.</p><p>Trump also wants prayer back in schools. My question is, which prayers? To what deity? Where? In one classroom or different classrooms for different religions?</p><p>Trump has no idea what the separation of powers is in the Constitution (something he obviously never read).</p><p>If we give him only one day as a dictator, he will make it for life.</p><p><b>CATHY DEREIMER</b>, PEACHTREE CORNERS</p><p><b>Single-sentence apologies show no contrition</b></p><p>The single-sentence apologies written for undermining Fulton County’s election results are offensive. The crime the Trump lawyers committed was an attempt to invalidate my vote; something most consider a sacred right.</p><p>They also hoped to change the election results in Georgia, an offense that would cause irreparable harm to Georgians. Ultimately, their goal was to illegally install Trump in an office rightfully won by President Biden. In doing this, they fanned flames of societal distrust and conflict that will last for years.</p><p>True contrition, as District Attorney Fani Willis hoped for, is an expression that should accomplish at least three things. It would let those harmed know there’s an empathetic and deep understanding of the harm. It would include an expression of heartfelt remorse for the actions committed and invoke a sincere promise never to do anything like this ever again.</p><p>I hope future convictions for this type of crime produce more satisfying results for all of us.</p><p><b>JEFF JOSLIN</b>, ATLANTA</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Morning, y’all! Another chilly start today, with temperatures in the high 20s. We’ll eventually reach the low 50s.</p><p><b>Today has us looking back and forward in the politics world:</b></p><ul><li>The Colorado Supreme Court declared former President Donald Trump ineligible for the White House and removed him from the state’s Republican primary ballot. <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/donald-trump-banned-from-colorado-ballot-in-historic-ruling-by-states-supreme-court/AKXHLPRG4JE23F37R7CHLUQLQA/">What could that mean for 2024</a>? </li><li>And in Georgia, the State Election Board <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/republican-move-to-investigate-raffensperger-over-2020-falls-short/PADBZBA7CZAUBAZCGKEQT75BC4/">deadlocked on opening an investigation</a> into Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger over the 2020 election, stymying efforts led by Republican Party activists.</li></ul><p>Plus, we’ve got details on <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/psc-raises-georgia-power-rates-passing-most-plant-vogtle-expansion-costs-on-to-customers/6BAIOWM7J5BVHFZ2UN27KYXENA/">another power bill increase</a>, big Southern population growth and college football’s early signing period.</p><p>Let’s get to it.</p><p>***</p><p><b>REDISTRICTING FIGHT</b></p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/0V-2HpvbBQ5sAZS89i1tXaYW8w4=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/OKWJLEDRYOS67NA4BRZQEDPXDE.JPG" alt="Rep. Richard Smith, R–Columbus, flips through a packet with revised congressional district maps during a reapportionment and redistricting hearing at the Georgia State Capitol on Tuesday, December 5, 2023. (Natrice Miller/natrice.miller@ajc.com)" height="600" width="1000"/><p>Today in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Judge Steve Jones will hear arguments about Georgia’s redistricting redo.</p><p>Did Republican leaders in the General Assembly follow his directions and bring the state’s political maps back into compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965? Or did they flaunt the directive, triggering another step in the high-stakes court battle?</p><p>Jones is expected to issue a new ruling quickly after the hearing — and his decision could carry national implications.</p><p><b>How we got here: </b>In October, Jones ordered the General Assembly to redraw the state’s congressional and legislative districts. He ruled that the Republican-led state redistricting efforts of 2021 <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/breaking-judge-throws-out-georgias-redistricting-orders-new-maps/OCXTSZBQ7ZGY7PWJWFELWRK6EA/" target="_blank">failed to provide adequate opportunities for Black voters</a> to elect the candidates of their choosing.</p><p>During a subsequent special session, legislators produced new maps that <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republicans-pass-maps-that-secure-control-of-general-assembly/WMWALXPMSVGKPOO4AF3U4D43GM/" target="_blank">preserve GOP majorities</a> in the General Assembly and the U.S. House. Gov. Brian Kemp <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-gov-kemp-signs-redistricting-bills-ahead-of-court-fight/DPROZVG6DZF6FID7ZZRVPX7H7I/" target="_blank">signed off on the maps</a> on Dec. 8.</p><p><b>The back-and-forth: </b>Republican leaders say they did what they were told, creating a new majority-Black congressional district and a total of seven new majority-Black districts in the General Assembly.</p><p>Democrats and voting rights groups say the new maps merely shuffle voters around without increasing Black representation. An AJC analysis <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgias-redrawn-maps-add-black-districts-but-not-representation/5AIXFQAP2FFEXPY2GXZCWSH2ZQ/" target="_blank">found much of the same</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-redistricting-challenges-protections-of-multiracial-coalitions/U6RILXMJKFFONLL5EKVXSVZZJU/" target="_blank">Georgia redistricting challenges protections of multiracial coalitions</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/black-fraternity-files-complaint-over-newly-drawn-georgia-political-maps/XIGVFC2DO5HULNKDLVVY62Z6EE/" target="_blank">Black fraternity files complaint over newly drawn Georgia maps</a></li></ul><p><b>The bigger picture:</b> While the Republican maps do increase the number of majority-Black districts, they also reduce the number of districts with “coalitions” of multiple minority groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates.</p><p>The Voting Rights Act makes it illegal to dilute the influence of a racial group. But experts say the courts have never decided if such coalitions qualify for protection. A ruling one way or another — either by Jones or a higher court judge — could establish a precedent with implications for lawmakers, voters and voter protections across the country.</p><p><b>What’s next: </b>If Jones approves the maps, they’ll go into effect for next year’s elections. If he finds that they still discriminate based on race, he’ll likely appoint an outside expert to draw new maps.</p><p>In the latter situation, the state would likely appeal — leaving it to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court to decide things.</p><p><i><b>Stay tuned to </b></i><a href="//ajc.com" target="_blank"><i><b>AJC.com</b></i></a><i><b> and follow reporters Maya Prabhu (</b></i><a href="https://twitter.com/MayaTPrabhu" target="_blank"><i><b>@MayaTPrabhu</b></i></a><i><b>) and Mark Niesse (</b></i><a href="https://twitter.com/markniesse" target="_blank"><i><b>@MarkNiesse</b></i></a><i><b>) for updates from today’s hearing and beyond.</b></i></p><p><i><b>Keep scrolling for more news.</b></i></p><p>***</p><p><b>TALK OF THE STATE</b></p><p>The Colorado Supreme Court issued a ruling disqualifying former President Donald Trump from the state’s Republican primary ballot for his efforts to upend the 2020 election. <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/colorado-ruling-disqualifying-trump-could-have-implications-in-georgia/L6WY72RSVJELXHVBNFT5RSTZUA/" target="_blank">A similar challenge</a> is pending against Georgia Lt.

				<![CDATA[<p><b>Q: I thought you were a Southerner, Walter! But in a recent AJC article, you spelled “crepe myrtle” as CRAPE myrtle. Shame, shame! This from an 80-year-old woman!</b><i>Gloria Duggar, email</i></p><p><b>A:</b> Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds ... .” Consistency, though, is what I strive for in my garden writing. All four spellings of the name of this plant (crepe myrtle, crepemyrtle, crape myrtle, and crapemyrtle) are acceptable in informal writing. In my garden writing, I try to use language that’s a little more formal, and I always try to use Latin names to distinguish plants if needed. A crapemyrtle is not actually a myrtle, so the descriptive part of the name should not be separate. Other examples include horsechestnut, mayapple, and redcedar. Several years ago, I decided that I would use the spelling that Michael Dirr, retired University of Georgia horticulture professor and internationally known expert on trees and shrubs, uses in his “Manual of Woody Plants.” He spells it as one word — “crapemyrtle” — and so do I.</p><p><b>Q: I have 1/4-inch fuzzy white bugs on my sage and basil plants. They are on my deck mixed with perennial flowering plants in pots, convenient to my kitchen. What is the best way to control the critters? Or should I toss the herbs and start over?</b><i>Tricia Bramblett, email</i></p><p><b>A:</b> I believe you have mealybugs. They are common on potted plants. Like their aphid kin, they suck plant sap and excrete sticky honeydew. I think your best course of action would be to remove the infested herb plants you use for cooking and discard them. Replace with fresh new plants in spring. These will inevitably be infested with mealybugs that move over from the flowering plants, but you can keep their numbers low with a weekly inspection. If you find any, spray them with store-bought insecticidal soap (not something you mix in the sink). The herbs can be cleaned of soap with a brisk rinse, and you’ll be able to cook with them.</p><p><b>Q: Does stacking dead branches between two pine trees do any harm to the trees?</b><i>Sam, email</i></p><p><b>A:</b> I don’t think it will do any harm. If the stack decomposes and becomes dense, it can hold moisture against the trunks and possibly cause rot. Pine voles or meadow voles could hide among the branches and chew on the roots and bark. I say if stacking limbs between two trees is what you want to do, go for it.</p><p><i>Email Walter at </i><a href="mailto:georgiagardener@yahoo.com"><i>georgiagardener@yahoo.com</i></a><i>. Listen to his occasional garden comments on “Green and Growing with Ashley Frasca” Saturday mornings on 95.5 WSB. Visit his website, </i><a href="http://www.walterreeves.com/"><i>www.walterreeves.com</i></a><i>, or join his Facebook page at </i><a href="http://bit.ly/georgiagardener"><i>bit.ly/georgiagardener</i></a><i> for his latest tips.</i></p><p><br/></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>About one-third of adults worldwide say they sometimes struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep. If you’re one of them, you may have tried sleep medications to find temporary tranquility.</p><p>There is a growing category of prescription pills, including suvorexant (Belsomra) and ramelteon (Rozerem), approved specifically for sleep. Doctors can also prescribe drugs such as the antidepressant mirtazepine (Remeron) off label for insomnia. And over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) can also double as sedatives.</p><p>“We’re really in a golden age” of insomnia drugs, said Dr. David Neubauer, a sleep specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Doctors can suggest different treatments depending on the type of sleep trouble you have — whether your mind is racing or you wake up multiple times in the middle of the night.</p><p>But all sleep drugs carry risks, such as daytime grogginess, and some are even habit-forming. That’s why experts say it’s best to limit how much you rely on them.</p><p>“The ideal use of these medications is only as needed, so I would say about two or three times a week, limited to a short period of time,” said Dr. Alcibiades Rodriguez, a sleep medicine expert at NYU Langone Health.</p><p><b>When should you use sleeping pills?</b></p><p>There are situations where using sleeping pills judiciously could be helpful, such as during a two- or three-week bout of insomnia triggered by a specific event. A doctor may also recommend sleeping pills as a last resort if you’ve failed to get restful sleep after trying lifestyle changes, such as avoiding screens at night, and cognitive behavioral therapy tactics designed specifically for sleep.</p><p>You should always consult with a health provider before you start taking sleep medication so you can make a plan for how long you’re going to take the pills. If you still need them after one month, talk to a doctor to determine if another treatment or medication would work better or to see if you have a condition that is contributing to your poor sleep and can’t be addressed with any sleeping pills.</p><p>What works for you will depend on the cause of your insomnia, Neubauer said. Rozerem works by stimulating the brain’s melatonin receptor to help you maintain a normal sleep cycle. Doctors sometimes prescribe drugs called benzodiazepines, which can both reduce anxiety and make you drowsy, if you have trouble falling asleep. These include alprazolam (Xanax) and clonazepam (Klonopin). There are also nonbenzodiazepine drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien) and eszopiclone (Lunesta), that can produce similar effects.</p><p><b>How bad is it to take sleeping pills every night?</b></p><p>Over-the-counter antihistamines haven’t been well studied for their effects on sleep, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against using them for insomnia. Many can linger in your system and cause daytime grogginess and falls. Long-term use can carry the risk of memory problems, confusion and constipation, all of which may be more pronounced in older adults. Some studies have suggested long-term antihistamine use is associated with increased dementia risk, although the link is not definitive.</p><p>Although they aren’t considered sleeping pills, many people also take supplements such as the hormone melatonin for insomnia. Experts said it’s important to note that many supplements have not been rigorously tested for effectiveness and may not contain the amount of melatonin listed on their labels — or any at all.</p><p>Prescription pills have their own side effects, from dizziness and headaches to gastrointestinal problems. You also shouldn’t mix them with certain drugs and substances, including alcohol, opiates and antidepressants. Doing so can further depress the central nervous system and result in slowed breathing, which can be dangerous, Neubauer said. And prescription sleeping pills can trigger sleepwalking or lead to severely impaired driving.</p><p>The body can become accustomed to these pills over time, so people often end up needing higher doses to get the same effect, Rodriguez said. With some of these drugs, especially benzodiazepines, this dependency can escalate into addiction. That’s why it can be so difficult for people to come off sleep medication and why many stay on prescription pills for years.</p><p><b>How do you wean yourself off?</b></p><p>You need a slow and strategic approach, said Dr. Jade Wu, a sleep psychologist at Duke University who also consults with sleep-wellness company Hatch. In some people, stopping sleep medication abruptly after more than a month of use can trigger withdrawal symptoms, which can include heightened anxiety, restlessness or rebound insomnia, meaning your sleep is disrupted again. Most experts recommend tapering your dose down over several weeks or months with the help of a doctor.</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia can also address the causes of insomnia, focusing on modifying behaviors and thought patterns that contribute to sleep problems. Studies have shown that CBT-I may provide a more durable alternative to medication.</p><p>It is also essential to set up good bedtime habits, such as sleeping in a dark room and avoiding screens, which can help with rebound insomnia.</p><p>“There might be some rocky nights here and there, but that’s OK,” Wu said. “Have faith that you’re not actually backsliding.”</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Madison Brow went with her mother to the East Point MARTA station in November for ... soccer.</p><p>The 7-year-old joined a youth league StationSoccer, which serves low-income communities with mini fields at six MARTA stations — <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/soccer-comes-five-points-marta-station/qCh9Ql9aFyZw8OsltLz7CL/" target="_blank">Little Five Points</a>, East Point, West End, Lindbergh, Kensington, and East Lake which opened in October.</p><p>Each station has a team associated with it. Madison was headed to the station in November for her team’s end of season party.</p><p>“One thing I most like about playing soccer here is my friends are here with me, my classmates, my teammates, and also watching myself improve,” Madison said.</p><p>Parents said the program helps develop leadership, social skills and confidence. Organizers say the locations are important for other reasons — it helps promote public transportation.</p><p>“We’ve seen (Madison) blossom in her leadership,” said Kelley Brow, Madison’s mother. “We’ve seen that transfer over to school and in church activities that she’s showing up as a leader everywhere.”</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/eWj4GeCDngbuSqyI5mDRwZHBXwQ=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/IU2ZTUH572YXMNZISSZOX4WHMQ.jpg" alt="Senator Jon Osoff speaks in support of Soccer in the Streets' new field at the East Lake Marta Station in Atlanta, Georgia on Friday, Oct, 27, 2023. (Olivia Bowdoin for the AJC)." height="600" width="1000"/><p>Every station, except East Point and Little Five Points, features two mini soccer fields, costing about $600,000 to build, executive director Elijah Miranda said. Both the East Point and Little Five Points stations have one field, due to a lack of space.</p><p>In addition to the fields, the West End station features a community garden, which the staff gardener uses to help teach kids about growing vegetables and healthy eating.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/xfu4YzG1pJEtF5bD4Y5aoKbf_vI=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/PYJB23GLDG2K6SM4WCNWSYPMZI.jpg" alt=" Kids play on  Soccer in the Streets'  new field at the East Lake Marta Station in Atlanta, Georgia on Friday, Oct, 27, 2023. (Olivia Bowdoin for the AJC)." height="600" width="1000"/><p>Stations are selected using various factors, including proximity to affordable housing and other programs in the area that provide access to youth sports, Miranda said.</p><p>The stations hold free soccer leagues for kids ages 4-14, and some adult leagues.</p><p>“Some more life lessons that are learned there around finances and financial literacy and managing your finances and responsibility and a job and that kind of thing,” Miranda said.</p><p>StationSoccer is an off-shoot of Soccer In The Streets, which was founded in 1989 by Carolyn McKenzie with the idea of starting a league that traveled to various cities, reaching children in public housing and other low-income communities. Today, the organization operates primarily in Atlanta, with leagues throughout the metro area.</p><p>“I think the way that we do it now, the impact is greater,” because the program is more consistent, Miranda said.</p><p>“Think of it as like the circus comes to town for like a week, and then it’s gone for like 51 weeks,” said Miranda, referring to how the program used to operate.</p><p>J.R. Adduci said his 7-year-old daughter, Charlie, is in her third season with the program at East Point.</p><p>“Charlie took to it like a moth to a flame. She loved it,” Adduci said.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/7eJAqAkOzOFpbCmEZpu1-DcVQ2k=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/XUPSZS7UC5AETAT5UAY6E4DDXE.jpg" alt="J.R. Adduci, said his daughter Charlie, 7, is in her third season with the program in East Point, and is really enjoying playing the sport.“Charlie took to it like a moth to a flame. She loved it,” Adduci said. Both Brow and Adduci are planning to keep their daughters in the program next season, which will begin early 2024." height="600" width="1000"/><p>Adduci said his wife thought it was important for Charlie to participate in a team sport because it could help keep her focused. It also gives kids a space for learning, he said.</p><p>“It’s just being outside and playing together. But in a structured environment, so that they’re learning stuff that they may or may not be getting at home,” Adduci said. “But if they are getting it at home ... it’s reinforcing manners, it’s reinforcing respect, it’s reinforcing discipline, it’s reinforcing just the common courtesy of your fellow teammates.”</p><p>Both Brow and Adduci are planning to keep their daughters in the program next season, which will begin early 2024.</p><p>The organization is working to open 10 StationSoccer locations by 2026, which will coincide with <a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/breaking-atlanta-will-host-part-of-2026-world-cup/VMJ6JYP5KFGJBKUETFRSICMIFE/" target="_blank">World Cup games in Atlanta. </a>Some of the new potential locations include the Hamilton E. Holmes and Doraville MARTA stations, Miranda said.</p><p>MARTA CEO Collie Greenwood said the organization was happy to play a role in helping create a place for kids in local communities.</p><p>“When you look around at<b></b>this space, it’s just space. It’s the fellowship that really makes it special,” Greenwood said.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Fred A. Jones Jr. is the senior director of public policy and advocacy for the <a href="https://southerneducation.org/">Southern Education Foundation</a>, a 156-year-old organization based in Atlanta. He lives with his family in Augusta and has a child enrolled in Georgia’s public school system.</p><p>In a guest column, Jones advises the Georgia General Assembly to look at education from pre-K through college and assure all levels have the funding and supports they need to succeed. His column is part of an Atlanta Journal-Constitution series in which education advocates set out an agenda for the 2024 General Assembly, which starts on Jan. 8.</p><p><b>By Fred A. Jones Jr.</b></p><p>As we begin the 2024 legislative session, Georgia leaders need to invest in and transform our education system to meet the unique needs of each student. Instead of segmenting early childhood, K-12, and higher education, legislators should frame and fund youth development in a way that comprehensively supports students’ individual educational pathways and supports them through the critical transitions in their young lives.</p><p><b>Make early childhood education more affordable.</b> Decades of <a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/untangling-evidence-preschool-effectiveness-report">research</a> show that thoughtful investments in accessible, high-quality early childhood education can increase children’s academic readiness, cognitive development, and overall wellness. Young learners ages birth to 5 who have high-quality early learning experiences also have higher rates of college enrollment and employment in adulthood, yielding annual returns on public investment as high as <a href="https://heckmanequation.org/resource/13-roi-toolbox/#:~:text=Professor%20Heckman%20and%20colleagues%20find,to%20work%20due%20to%20childcare">13%.</a></p><p>Beyond the benefits of early learning, many Georgia families simply cannot afford child care, limiting parents’ ability to work. The average yearly cost for infant care in our state is <a href="https://info.childcareaware.org/hubfs/2019%20Price%20of%20Care%20State%20Sheets/Georgia.pdf?utm_campaign=2019%20Cost%20of%20Care&utm_source=2019%20COC%20-%20GA">nearly $9,000</a> — higher than the average tuition and fees at our state universities and more than half of the cost of the average Georgia home mortgage payment. Ideally, child care costs should not exceed <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/07/11/new-rule-proposed-improve-child-care-access-affordability-stability.html#:~:text=Lower%20Families'%20Child%20Care%20Costs%3A%20Reduces%20the%20significant%20financial%20strain,or%20below%20150%25%20of%20the">7%</a> of a family’s discretionary income.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/RpdWMuDep9Nz-IcRilUCTE7sPsQ=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/IZO4KO5X5BGTRC4RYTMVAUOO6M.jpeg" alt="Fred A. Jones Jr." height="600" width="1000"/><p>Georgia should also expand eligibility for state child care subsidies to more families with extremely low incomes. The current eligibility rate is one of the worst in the nation. The state also should boost reimbursement for child care providers so they can afford to pay more competitive wages. Higher reimbursements would also help alleviate severe staffing shortages and lack of providers in some communities.</p><p>Also, a majority of our state’s 3- and 4-year-olds <a href="https://www.aecf.org/blog/low-preschool-enrollment-rates-threaten-to-worsen-student-achievement">are <i>not</i> enrolled</a> in state pre-K classes. In fact, Georgia has <a href="https://nieer.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Georgia_YB2022.pdf">fallen behind</a><a href="https://nieer.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Florida_YB2022.pdf">Florida</a> and other states in the rate of 4-year-olds enrolled in state pre-K programs (55% in Georgia vs. 68% in Florida). The state must expand pre-K to allow both 3- and 4-year-olds to enroll, with an emphasis on children from low-income families who often start school behind.</p><p><b>Update the K-12 public education funding system.</b> Georgia continues to be one of six states that do not consider poverty as a factor in the state’s school funding formula. An “<a href="https://gbpi.org/state-of-education-funding-2023-opportunity-is-knocking/">opportunity weight</a>” that allocates funding for each student living in a low-income household should be one of the highest priorities. We know that financial resources matter in the opportunities schools can offer, and targeted investments for personalized learning, smaller classroom sizes, and recruiting and retaining a high-quality, diverse educator workforce. Adding an opportunity weight would target more resources where they are needed the most, leading to better student outcomes.</p><p>State leaders must also deal with the expected fiscal cliff when federal pandemic-relief funds for schools expire. The negative impacts of the pandemic persist even as this funding ends: By some estimates, nearly <a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_USA/">15,000 children</a> in Georgia lost <a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/georgia-children-who-lost-parents-to-covid-19-struggle-with-grief/VSJCJHJNDBFLPKGV4ONZP3U7KE/" target="_blank">primary caregivers</a> due to the pandemic. Students’ mental health must remain a priority throughout our education system. Many students need a range of wraparound services, both academic and nonacademic, to address the challenges that the pandemic only exacerbated.</p><p>Last year, the Legislature considered a universal <a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/georgia-voucher-bill-came-close-to-passing-but-lacked-enough-gop-votes/DNBHKAWSCRBBFKVEI6NIU355AE/" target="_blank">school voucher program</a> that would have redirected billions of state dollars from public schools to private schools. The bill would have also created a legal mechanism for anti-civil rights violations. The proposal was defeated last year for several reasons, including the massive financial impact it would have had on local school districts, particularly in rural communities. Legislators should focus on improving and supporting our state’s public education system instead of creating a separate education system that lacks credible evidence and research on improving students’ academic outcomes.</p><p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/get-schooled-blog/opinion-vouchers-rise-again-to-haunt-the-georgia-legislature/EYNALTPMGNG43NR6RNVMPVWFYM/">Opinion: Vouchers return to haunt the Georgia Legislature</a></p><p><b>Support HBCUs and student success. </b>Legislators should continue building on their collaborations in 2023 to support Georgia’s historically Black colleges and universities.</p><p>Last year, a Senate study committee chaired by state Sen. Sonya Halpern of Atlanta traveled the state to learn more about Georgia’s HBCUs. The committee found that HBCUs are often the best value in higher education, providing strong learning communities, investing in students’ growth beyond the classroom, and helping large proportions of Black students (many of whom attended under-resourced K-12 schools) earn their degrees at higher-than-average rates.</p><p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/lawmakers-push-for-planning-districts-to-strengthen-georgias-hbcus/TV6TTBNFK5HIBPNYLANME5LWUM/">Lawmakers push for planning districts to strengthen Georgia’s HBCUs</a></p><p>The Senate study committee also detailed in its <a href="https://www.senate.ga.gov/committees/Documents/HBCUSFinalReport12.15.22.pdf">report</a> that with the right investments, HBCUs can become stronger economic engines for the state. Modest new investments in these institutions, which often lack larger endowments in comparison to the state’s flagship university, could help them serve more students and develop new housing and small businesses in HBCU communities.</p><p>A <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/nourishing-the-nation-while-starving-the-underfunding-of-black-land-grant-colleges-and-universities/">recent study</a> by the Century Foundation clearly outlines the funding disadvantages for HBCUs, especially land-grant institutions such as Fort Valley State University. Several HBCU alumni in Georgia have filed a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/federal-lawsuit-alleges-underfunding-of-georgias-three-public-hbcus/PJDA4JNJSNBGZDXYRDXJS2RJHI/">federal lawsuit</a> against the state, seeking hundreds of millions of dollars to correct historic funding inequities in the state. The state’s underinvestment in Fort Valley State has resulted in a funding gap of about <a href="https://sites.ed.gov/whhbcu/files/2023/09/Secretary-letter-1890.pdf?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term">$600 million</a> over the last three decades alone, compared to levels the state would have provided if resources had been allocated fairly.</p><p>Legislators should also consider forming an HBCUs subcommittee as an official forum for legislation on the needs of these institutions and their potential to make a greater impact on our state and future leaders. Important steps like this could lead to greater opportunities for Georgians to be prepared for high-demand careers in technology, advanced manufacturing, teaching, and nursing.</p><p>These recommendations for legislative action in 2024 across the education spectrum are not just a wish list. They are essential steps that will help every corner of our state thrive, grow more economically competitive, and help Georgia remain a top state for business. This year, state leaders have an opportunity to make the people’s priorities for education their own.</p><p><br/></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>A decade ago, I attended a parents’ gathering at the University of Chicago where a son was attending and asked the school’s health and counseling chief at the time what he had noticed about kids during his 20 years on the job.</p><p>Students increasingly had a hard time bouncing back from routine stumbles, said Dr.<b></b>Alex Lickerman.</p><p>“Parents have not allowed their children to fail and don’t have high expectations for their kids on handling failure,” he said, later adding, “In the past 10 to 20 years<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/bubble-wrapped-kids-search-safe-space/vJoQWBHyClgkSVeNdOyYTJ/" target="_blank"> everyone has become fragile.</a> We have to be careful about what we say. This generation is so easily offended.”</p><p>It’s only gotten worse since.</p><p>More than 40% of Generation Z, those born between 1996 and 2010, say they have a diagnosed mental health condition, says a 2022<b></b>study from the health data <a href="https://www.harmonyhit.com/state-of-gen-z-mental-health/" target="_blank">management firm Harmony Healthcare IT.</a> And last week, an AJC story <a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/suffering-in-silence-male-college-students-less-likely-to-seek-counseling/XK4SIKMMRZEQXBBOFHOW2V4QNA/" target="_blank">noted another study from this spring<b></b>that said almost 40% of female college students</a> and 22.5% of males received psychological or mental health services in the course of a year.</p><p>This has caused Gen Z to be known as The Most Anxious Generation.</p><p>The explanations are many: The pandemic, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/education/get-schooled-blog/psychologist-no-phones-until-high-school-and-no-social-media-until-age-16/EKBYDEREXZFVVH6GZ37KH6B2NY/" target="_blank">cellphones</a>, social media and worries about the future.</p><p>Now add another argument — the lack of independent play for kids. For decades, parents have bubble-wrapped their kids to shield them from life’s woes and, as they grow up, they have a hard time when things go amiss.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/SJZ691PgfL9hafZ6G9gUJ1t7iEc=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/ZS4HCW3M66KG3F4NCIGNA52VYA.jpg" alt="APS Police Chief Ronald Applin walks through their evidence at a press conference at Atlanta Public Schools Alonzo A. Crim Center on Oct. 11, 2019. STEVE SCHAEFER / SPECIAL TO THE AJC" height="600" width="1000"/><p>Since the 1980s and the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local/torpy-large-stranger-danger-always-lurking-only-media-shadows/5271qouHFXuLHe8vwBYB8M/" target="_blank">advent of “Stranger Danger” and fears about missing kids,</a> parents have kept a tight leash on their young ones, driving them from piano lessons to lacrosse to ACT practice testing instead of letting them hang out with friends and figure out life for themselves.</p><p>I called Lenore Skenazy, <a href="https://letgrow.org/" target="_blank">head of Let Grow,</a> a New York<b></b>nonprofit promoting childhood independence. For years, she’s been ruing the lack of unstructured play.</p><p>It used to be simple. “You go outside, see who’s out there and come up with something to do,” she said. “You come up with rules, make it fair, make it interesting. You learn to include people, how to deal with jerks, how to compromise. It’s all the human interaction and skills you need later in life: Making friends, deadlines, dealing with bosses, confusion and depression.</p><p>“If you’re in organized activities, then you’re not playing, you’re in class,” Skenazy said. “You’re not learning the messy stuff because adults are ironing it out for you.”</p><p>She calls it a “culture of passivity” where creativity, exploration and, yes, risk, is weeded out in exchange for a sense of safety.</p><p>You might have noted on Halloween that few kids are unsupervised as they Trick or Treat. Instead, they are dutifully shuffled from house to house by adult chaperones. As an 8-year-old, that’s the last thing on Earth we’d have wanted.</p><p>A recent University of Michigan poll found an overwhelming number of parents think its important for kids to have free time (84% of the parents of 9-11 year-olds).</p><p>BUT just 33% allow their kids to walk or bike to a friend’s house and just 50% would let their 9-11 year-olds walk to another aisle at the store without them to fetch a couple of items.</p><p><a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/promoting-childrens-independence-what-parents-say-vs-do" target="_blank">I’m not kidding!</a></p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/s6-ZmhqX1p_4rHq_1wTHfHSggKI=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/6YJFV25JHJHLPNOJGKYNRI3XCY.jpg" alt="Lenore Skenazy, was called the "world's worst mom" in 2008 when she allowed her then-9-year-old son to ride the New York City subway home alone. It became a national story and she later founded Let Grow to advocate for "free range kids"" height="600" width="1000"/><p>A <a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(23)00111-7/fulltext" target="_blank">recent paper in the The Journal of Pediatrics</a>, entitled<b></b>“Decline in Independent Activity as a Cause of Decline in Children’s Mental Well-being,” also decries the dearth of free play.</p><p>“We’re overprotecting them,” said Peter Gray, a research professor of psychology at Boston College and one of the authors. “There’s a loss of the internal locus of control (in children), a sense that ‘I can manage things. I can deal with problems.’ ”</p><p>Such a loss in one’s formative years “sets you up for anxiety and depression later when you face stresses in life.”</p><p>Gray, another founder of Let Grow, wrote a book on the subject 10 years ago, <i>Free to Learn. </i>At the time “universities were dealing with anxiety, depression and students not being prepared for life — for bad grades or romantic breakups, the normal bumps in the road.”</p><p>It’s worse now, he said.</p><p>“Some professors were afraid to give anything less than an ‘A’ because students were breaking down,” Gray said, adding that a female student needed a break from studies because a roommate called her something that rhymes with “itch.”</p><p>Parents, he said, have become obsessed with building their children’s resumes at the price of their independence.</p><p>There’s been a strong argument that cellphones and social media, is causing this wave of anxiety. “That’s more acceptable for people to believe because it’s easier to blame social media than blame ourselves,” he said.</p><p>David Bjorklund, who studies evolutionary developmental psychology and one of the authors, said that for eons young children left their mother’s side “and were essentially let loose with other kids in the community. They all learned from one another. The young kids watched the older kids and the older ones learned how to be responsible and to be teachers.</p><p>“You need to take into account natural learning environments, kids are keen observers, keen imitators,” he said. Such a dynamic existed with humanity since the days of hunter-gatherers.</p><p>But back then, the future hunters weren’t driven to soccer lessons.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Christmastime is here and I recently learned that I have just reached the age when I can expect fewer Christmas gifts than I have ever received in my life.</p><p>If you are between the ages of 53 and 76, you had better quickly find the real meaning of Christmas because you will not find it wrapped in pretty boxes underneath the tree. Apparently, the best age for receiving Christmas gifts is 16 or 17. That’s when you get the most gifts with the highest value, according to data from CouponBird.</p><p>Honestly, I’m not too upset by this information. I have received some amazing Christmas gifts over the years, so I’ve had a good run. But this news did get me thinking about the whole gift-giving business that causes so much stress during the holidays.</p><p>In a group chat, one friend shared a school communication that included a 5-day schedule for secret Santa gifts. Each day of the week, students were required to bring in a gift (candy, cards, ornaments) for their Secret Santa giftee culminating in a big gift valued at $10 or more (Yes, more. Not less).</p><p>Another friend shared that her daughter took part in the TikTok trend in which teenagers create sophisticated holiday slide presentations instead of the usual handwritten gift lists. For these tech-savvy kids — links, photos and QR codes have become the pathway to Christmas gift gratification.</p><p>Before you start rolling your eyes and wailing about the commercialization of Christmas (which I TOTALLY understand), consider why these more scripted approaches to gift giving might make sense.</p><p>Christmas is the season for giving, but it can also be a season of wasted money if you aren’t careful about what you give. It feels good to nail a gift and watch the recipient scream with happiness or cry tears of joy, but this gets increasingly difficult with age.</p><p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/atlanta-winter-guide/gift-guides/">The AJC 2023 Gift Guide</a></p><p>Once kids reach preteen years, it can be very hard to find a surprise gift that kids want. They are probably past the stage of writing to Santa but not quite at the age where you can give them gift cards and tell them to go buy whatever they want. It feels like the right age to stop surprising and start asking for input.</p><p>When I was 12, I distinctly remember realizing that my parents’ had no idea that I was growing up and the evidence was under the tree. The Steven Spielberg movie, “E.T.” had been released that summer and one of my gifts was an E.T. action figure. If you know the movie, you know there wasn’t much action from E.T. other than his neck extending about two feet into the air. I did like the movie, but I would have preferred clothing or a good book as a Christmas gift.</p><p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t end in childhood. One friend received a 12-month whisky sampler from her housemate for Christmas. She doesn’t drink whiskey and the sampler has since found a new life as a laptop stand. Now each year, she creates her own personal gift guide so if anyone wants to buy her a gift, they have a document referencing desired items. But she’s in that 53 to 76 age bracket, so she probably won’t be getting much of anything this Christmas.</p><p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/things-to-do/atlanta-winter-guide/">AJC Holiday Guide</a></p><p>Gifting stress doesn’t only come from what to buy, but also who to give a gift and how to get it to them.</p><p>Years ago, to relieve some of the gifting stress, my sister and I agreed not to exchange gifts on Christmas (we give each other gifts whenever we feel like it). We only buy gifts for the kids in the family and no one expects kids to buy gifts for grownups. This works for us but when I mentioned it to a childless friend, she noted that anyone without kids would get the short end of that deal.</p><p>Another family I know does a gift exchange. All names go into a hat and each person only buys a gift for the person whose name they draw. Gifts for other people are optional. My friend usually ends up buying gifts for everyone, but at least he would be off the hook if he decided not to.</p><p>If you travel for Christmas, particularly by plane or train, gifts can present yet another challenge. I’ve shipped gifts then asked family members to hide them from the intended recipients until I arrived to wrap them. I have attempted to pack gifts in my suitcase even as I worried about someone ransacking my bags and reaping the rewards, which recently happened to another friend.</p><p>I decided there had to be a better way to give gifts that doesn’t involve a guessing game or extreme packing and that doesn’t result in wasted money for a gift no one will ever use.</p><p>My daughter did not make a Christmas wish list this year, so I just asked her what she wants. I have a few surprises planned, but they aren’t high-stakes items and are things she has mentioned in the past.</p><p>For the kids in my extended family, most of whom are now adults or teenagers, I’m buying gift cards.</p><p>And if you’re my age or older, sorry, you’re just out of luck.</p><p><i>Read more on the Real Life blog (</i><a href="https://www.ajc.com/opinion/real-life-blog/"><i>www.ajc.com/opinion/real-life-blog/</i></a><i>) and find Nedra on Facebook (</i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AJCRealLifeColumn"><i>www.facebook.com/AJCRealLifeColumn</i></a><i>) and Twitter (</i><a href="https://twitter.com/nrhoneajc"><i>@nrhoneajc</i></a><i>) or email her at </i><a href="mailto:Nedra.Rhone@ajc.com"><i>nedra.rhone@ajc.com</i></a><i>.</i></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>The Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling that former President Donald Trump can’t hold office again could have legal implications in Georgia, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24228491-quo-warranto-burt-jones">where the state’s No. 2 politician</a> also faces an ongoing lawsuit seeking to disqualify him.</p><p>Colorado’s <a href="https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Opinions/2023/23SA300.pdf">top court issued a ruling late Tuesday</a> that ordered that Trump be removed from the state’s Republican primary ballot, finding that he violated the U.S. Constitution’s insurrection clause by seeking to reverse his 2020 defeat to President Joe Biden.</p><p>The decision may not stand. Trump’s campaign swiftly promised to appeal what it called a “completely flawed” decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has the final word on state constitutional matters.</p><p>Still, it’s the first time in U.S. history the 14th Amendment has been used to disqualify a presidential candidate, and Trump’s critics say it could help other legal efforts around the nation and in Georgia that target Trump and his allies.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24228491-quo-warranto-burt-jones">separate longshot challenge</a> is now pending in Butts County Superior Court against Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, where four left-leaning plaintiffs say in a 47-page lawsuit that the Republican should be disqualified for his role in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat.</p><p>It’s part of a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66690276">coordinated legal effort by Democrats</a> to disqualify Trump and key allies by invoking Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars anyone who swore an oath to “support” the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from seeking office.</p><p>Similar lawsuits targeting Trump in Minnesota and New Hampshire have been dismissed, while a Michigan judge ruled that it should be up to Congress and not the judiciary to decide whether the former president can seek office again.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/D7GFCCOc4X7MueV38IQa7pPOGxw=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/5QZ5EAB2IJEUDGSSFLADHGH4ZU.jpg" alt="Federal judge says Ga. voters can challenge Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s reelection bid" height="600" width="1000"/><p>The liberal group that filed those lawsuits, <a href="https://freespeechforpeople.org/challenge-to-marjorie-taylor-greene-under-14-3-insurrectionist-disqualification-clause/">Free Speech for People</a>, also sought to disqualify U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene last year. After a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-seeks-to-defeat-legal-challenge-to-her-candidacy/AMNSYL6JPNHBFCE5ASX65D4UT4/" target="_blank">daylong hearing in April 2022,</a> a Georgia judge ruled the challengers had “<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-rules-marjorie-taylor-greene-should-stay-on-the-ballot/AHDS6IKHJJCHLDHS7RTIL3JSVM/">failed to prove their case</a>” against the Rome Republican.</p><p>On Tuesday, Greene said the Colorado decision “stole the election away from the people of Colorado and robbed them of their right” to vote for Trump.</p><p>The challenge against Jones was filed this month by four plaintiffs who said the lieutenant governor has “forfeited his right to hold public office and to discharge the duties” and claims he is an “oath-breaking person.”</p><p>It invoked how Jones served as a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/lg-candidates-involvement-in-fake-gop-electors-draws-republican-scrutiny/PUOCCJE4NZEG5FBQKWLQZD23SI/">pro-Trump elector</a> after state officials certified Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/republicans-behind-giulianis-georgia-hearings-mum-on-his-false-statements/JV2PWQCKHVA5ZKX4ZYHRGMEPUY/">helped organize legislative hearings</a> that promoted conspiracy theories about the vote and called for a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/why-kemp-wont-call-an-illegal-special-session-to-overturn-georgias-election/6L6KT2NZEZCU7MYXADEBLIO6S4/">special legislative session</a> to hear allegations of voting fraud.</p><p>Jones also <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-republican-lawmakers-say-they-were-right-to-back-texas-lawsuit-against-state/KNYRTPJUAJHMBGWXQKVE43AQMY/">sided with Texas</a> in a lawsuit that sought to invalidate Georgia’s presidential election results and <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-before-seige-of-us-capitol-five-state-senators-asked-mike-pence-to-hold-off-declaring-joe-biden-the-next-president/3OJNZ54GFRCDXOE356JWBU5XZQ/">signed a letter</a> urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to postpone certification of election results. Jones planned to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/opinion-a-letter-that-wasnt-delivered-and-a-lie-that-wont-go-away/BUA3XRJR2BCMBF4GOOVSEQ7KO4/">deliver the letter</a> to Pence during a Jan. 5, 2021 dinner but later told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he changed his mind.</p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/PKKYetg2J-L2iO6PHCoiezk8fk8=/1000x600/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/LYVDCDR6FRQATJA2ENK6H2ZP24.JPG" alt="Lt.

(Natrice Miller/natrice.miller@ajc.com)" height="600" width="1000"/><p>Superior Court Judge Thomas Wilson didn’t rule from the bench after a Monday hearing on the complaint but appeared skeptical of the plaintiff’s arguments, at one point saying their lawsuit seemed “far-fetched.”</p><p>Wayne Kendall, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said Tuesday that he expects the judge to reject the lawsuit — and that he will appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. Still, Kendall said the Colorado court’s decision could buoy his lawsuit’s slim chances of success.</p><p>“It’s not a controlling case, but it is persuasive,” said Kendall. “It doesn’t hurt us, certainly. I’m looking forward to getting it to the Georgia Supreme Court, where I think we’ll get a fair reading of the law.”</p><p>Some legal scholars say the Colorado ruling could wind up bolstering Jones’ defense. Anthony Michael Kreis, who teaches constitutional law at Georgia State University, said the decision sharpened the definition for what it means to offer “aid or comfort” to insurrectionists.</p><p>“I have not seen tangible evidence that Jones provided active assistance to those engaged in the Jan. 6 insurrection,” Kreis said. “More likely than not, whatever conduct Jones is alleged to be engaged in doesn’t reach anywhere near Trump’s level, or those involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection.”</p><p>The lieutenant governor, meanwhile, has said he and Trump are both “being targeted by liberal Democrats intent on weaponizing the legal system against strong conservatives fighting for commonsense conservative values.”</p><p>“The voters get to decide who represents them in Georgia, not Democrat operatives,” Jones said in a statement to the AJC. “I won’t let them subvert the will of the people. I’ll continue fighting back against the radical Democrats in Georgia and around the country.”</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Atlanta United selected goalkeepers Jayden Hibbert of Connecticut and Casper Mols from Kentucky in the MLS draft on Tuesday.</p><p>Atlanta United Vice President Carlos Bocanegra said they selected two goalkeepers (Hibbert with the 19th overall pick and Mols at No. 77) to help bridge the gap between the team’s trio of veterans and those in the academy. Bocanegra said both have good size and potential to play in MLS. Bocanegra said they are having conversations with both about whether they will sign now or return to school.</p><p>“It was really just something we wanted to bulk up that position,” Bocanegra said. “And we’re really happy with the two that were selected.”</p><p>Hibbert, who has family in Atlanta and Savannah, was considered the No. 2-rated goalkeeper in this draft. Hibbert, a sophomore, has made 20 appearances for the Huskies. Hibbert said his dream is to play professionally. He said he hopes that negotiations go well.</p><p>“I’d love to start my career at Atlanta united,” he said. “I think the academy is great. I think the second team is great. I think the first team environment is phenomenal. So I’m so ecstatic that they selected me in the draft with the 19th pick.”</p><p>If Hibbert returns to school, Atlanta United would retain his rights.</p><p>Hibbert said he is good with the ball at his feet because of his experience in youth soccer playing as a right wing. When he turned eight years old, Hibbert said he played goalkeeper two age groups up for one team and right wing for his age group on another. This continued until he turned 13 when he moved to the Red Bulls academy.</p><p>Hibbert said he hopes to “be a sponge” and learn from Brad Guzan, Quentin Westberg and Josh Cohen. Hibbert said he understands that he will most likely play for Atlanta United 2 in MLS Next Pro.</p><p>“I’ve seen the level and it’s just a step up from college,” he said. “So I’m super-excited to learn from the goalkeeper coach, f rom the goalkeepers and ultimately get some minutes with the second team to help the team win some games.”</p><p>Mols, a sophomore from Kentucky, allowed 16 goals in 15 appearances this season.</p><p>Additionally, the team <a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-united/atlanta-united-signs-garrison-tubbs/CGUEZWNESZC2RPFUG7GHVXTTWM/" target="_blank">traded Garrison Tubbs</a>, whom it just signed to a Homegrown contract on Friday, to D.C. United in exchange for more than $200,000 in Allocation Money. Bocanegra said there was interest in Tubbs, so signing him was a way for the team generate some Allocation Money for other moves it hopes to make.</p><p>Atlanta United received the 33rd pick in the draft in a trade with the L.A. Galaxy in exchange for the rights to Miguel Berry. Atlanta United traded that pick and the 72nd pick to Chicago for $50,000 in General Allocation Money.</p><p>The team selected Javier Armas, a senior midfielder/defender from Oregon State, with the No. 48 pick. He made 77 appearances, with 71 starts. Armas played in Deportivo La Coruna’s academy in Spain. Bocanegra said they liked his versatility. </p><p>Atlanta United has had more misses than hits in the drafts, which is not uncommon. The hits include selecting Miles Robinson and Julian Gressel in its first draft in 2017, Jon Gallagher the next year and Aiden McFadden in 2021.</p><p>Atlanta United draft selections through the years:</p><p><b>2017: </b>Miles Robinson, Julian Gressel, Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu, Alex Kapp</p><p><b>2018: </b>Jon Gallagher, Oliver Shannon, Gordon Wild, Paul Christensen</p><p><b>2019: </b>Anderson Asiedu, Amir Bashti</p><p><b>2020: </b>Patrick Nielsen, Phillip Goodrum</p><p><b>2021: </b>Josh Bauer</p><p><b>2022: </b>Tristan Trager, Daniel Bloyou, Erik Centeno, Tola Showumni</p><p><b>2023: </b>Jayden Hibbert, Javier Armas, Casper Mols</p><p><b>For more content about Atlanta United</b></p><p>Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DougRobersonAJC">@DougRobersonAJC</a></p><p>On Facebook at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/atlantaunitednewsnow/">Atlanta United News Now</a></p><p>On Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/douglasdavidroberson/">DouglasDavidRoberson</a></p><p>Atlanta United coverage on The <a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-united/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></p><p><b>Southern Fried Soccer podcast can be found</b></p><p>Apple - <a href="https://apple.co/3ISD6Ve">https://apple.co/3ISD6Ve</a></p><p>Spotify - <a href="https://spoti.fi/3L8TN0C">https://spoti.fi/3L8TN0C</a></p><p>Google podcasts - <a href="https://bit.ly/32KlZW3">https://bit.ly/32KlZW3</a></p><p>If you are listening to us for the first time, please follow us on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcast ... and if you like what you hear, please give us a good rating so we can grow the show.

				<![CDATA[<p>An Atlanta lawyer and business owner previously employed by the city as a police officer and attorney was found guilty Tuesday of defrauding the federal government out of more than $7 million in Paycheck Protection Program funds.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged Shelitha Robertson used the funds her businesses received to buy a Rolls-Royce car, a motorcycle, and a 10-carat diamond ring for $148,000, among other things.</p><p>Robertson had <a href="https://www.ajc.com/neighborhoods/dekalb/indicted-dekalb-sewer-contractor-proclaims-innocence-in-ppp-fraud-case/OI3TQJMGA5G7RD6GUVVH6E5TME/">denied</a> grossly exaggerating the number of people employed by four of her companies in order to obtain millions of dollars in federal aid designed to keep small businesses afloat during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>She blamed her companies’ fraudulent 2020 PPP loan applications on her then-friend and personal attorney, Chandra Norton, who pleaded guilty in a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/neighborhoods/dekalb/dekalb-continues-contracting-with-company-of-woman-guilty-of-federal-fraud/TTFHMX7AEBDMXHOQUWMGNRUK3Y/">separate prosecution</a>.</p><p>A jury of seven men and five women deliberated for about 13 hours over two days before finding Robertson guilty on three counts of wire fraud and single counts of money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p><p>Robertson, who has remained on bond since pleading not guilty to the five charges in December 2022, was immediately remanded into<b></b>custody pending her sentencing, for which a date has yet to be set.</p><p>Federal prosecutor Ariel Glasner said Robertson had threatened to kill Norton upon arrest and separately threatened another person who subsequently filed a police report.</p><p>Craig A. Gillen, Robertson’s lead attorney, said her remarks to arresting agents about Norton were made in frustration and did not constitute a legitimate threat. He said Robertson was separately involved in a business dispute with a contractor in Texas, in which no threat was made.</p><p>“There’s no history of violence or anger or danger by the defendant to anybody other than the statement she made when she was arrested,” Gillen said.</p><p>Robertson occasionally shook her head from side to side after U.S. District Judge Steven D. Grimberg read the verdict but otherwise showed little reaction. Gillen said aspects of the trial, including the presentation of what he described as hearsay evidence, would be raised on appeal.</p><p>Prosecutors said Robertson and Norton were best friends and partners in crime who together schemed to get as much money in PPP loans as they could, ultimately receiving almost $8 million.</p><p>Robertson transferred $50,000 in PPP funding to her daughter, who has not been charged, withdrew $25,000 of the funds in cash, and gave Norton $400,000, prosecutors said.</p><p>Gillen said Robertson was the victim of Norton’s plan to use Robertson’s personal and business information to enrich herself. Norton was “financially desperate,” he said.</p><p>Norton is an “evil genius” and a technological whizz adept at falsifying documents, while Robertson is a “boots on the ground” type who “can barely turn a computer on after it goes to sleep,” Gillen told the jury.</p><p>“Norton was, and frankly still is, a master of deception,” Gillen said during his closing argument on Monday. “Norton told Ms. Robertson ‘Hey, you can get these PPP loans. I’ll handle it.’”</p><p>Both women ran companies awarded multimillion-dollar water and sewer infrastructure contracts across metropolitan Atlanta.</p><p>Norton was indicted in August 2020 and pleaded guilty several months later to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She agreed as part of a plea deal to cooperate with the federal government against Robertson, who was <a href="https://www.ajc.com/neighborhoods/dekalb/second-dekalb-sewer-contractor-accused-of-pandemic-relief-fraud/E3XIYAP5DVDVBOA6K6OY2OFEIM/">indicted</a> in December 2022.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.ajc.com/neighborhoods/dekalb/dekalb-cutting-ties-with-company-founded-by-admitted-federal-fraudster/7UEWUY52U5CLTETUV7YI3OVO7I/">former contractor</a> for Atlanta and DeKalb County, Norton was disbarred after pleading guilty and is due to be sentenced by Grimberg in January.</p><p>Robertson received PPP loans for her companies Atlanta Custom Motors, MO Griggs Contracting, Tritan, and The Renee Group. Only the latter was operational at the time, with 13 employees, case records show.</p><p>The loan applications for Robertson’s companies, however,<b></b>listed a combined 427 employees and $2.8 million in monthly payroll expenses. Prosecutors said The Renee Group’s annual payroll cost $762,674 in 2019 — a fraction of what Robertson claimed.</p><p>Robertson signed the Renee Group loan application and admitted that she knew Norton submitted similar applications for Robertson’s three inoperative companies. Robertson said Norton told her the loans were based on Robertson’s net worth.</p><p>Gillen said Robertson repaid the PPP funds she received, with interest, “because it was the right thing to do, not because she got caught.”</p><p>Prosecutor Bernita Malloy said Robertson, a former public defender, is a conniving fast-talker who participated in the fraud and whose defense “defies logic and is absolutely ludicrous.” Malloy said Norton submitted the false loan applications under the direction of Robertson, who told Norton how much money she wanted.</p><p>“There’s no level to which (Robertson) wouldn’t stoop to justify her criminal conduct,” Malloy said in her closing argument on Monday. “She disguised what she did to avoid getting caught.

				<![CDATA[<p>Falcons owner Arthur Blank discussed coach Arthur Smith’s status and the plight of quarterback Desmond Ridder in an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting on Tuesday.</p><p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-falcons/falcons-arthur-smith-hears-the-calls-for-his-job/X755XDWTMNE2VHPWCOBOLFLZ7E">Arthur Smith hears the calls for his job</a></p><p>He was on the program to discuss legendary Georgians on behalf of his foundation and veteran journalist Jeff Hullinger, a former team announcer, slipped in a few football questions.</p><p>Blank was non-committal about Smith’s status for next season.</p><p>“We’re committed to coach Smith,” said Blank when asked if Smith would be the coach in 2024. “We’re going to play these last three games. We’ll play them to win them. We’ll let the season play out and go from there.”</p><p>The Falcons are currently 6-8 and are coming off a horrible 9-7 loss to the Panthers, who were 1-12 before the contest. The Falcons are in second place in the NFC South, one game behind the Bucs and Saints with three games to play.</p><p>The Falcons’ playoff probability is at 7%, according to the New York Times playoff simulation. They will play their regular-season home finale Sunday against the Colts (8-6) with road games against the Bears (5-9) and Saints (7-7) to end the season.</p><p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/mark-bradley-blog/bradleys-buzz-the-falcons-lose-the-kind-of-game-that-gets-people-fired/ZO7U25EBWJHC5KLTCRVN47AQ6E/">Bradley: Loss to Panthers is kind of game that gets people fired</a></p><p>The Falcons only have one win over a team with a winning record (Houston). Blank said that making the playoffs was not a requirement for Smith to retain his job.</p><p>“That was never really a requirement,” Blank said. “The requirement was that we have a more competitive team this year. A winning team this year. I think that through this part of the season it’s been mixed quite honestly…We’ll see how the season plays out and go from there.”</p><p>Here’s the football portion of the interview:</p><p><b>Hullinger: In 2024 is Arthur Smith going to be the head coach of your football team?</b></p><p><b>Blank:</b> “We’re committed to Coach Smith. We’re going to play these last three games. We’ll play them to win them. We’ll let the season play out and go from there. Obviously, this has not been the kind of year that we expected. You’ll hear that first from Coach Smith. You’d hear it from our Fans. You’d hear it from our players. We understand that. We understand the challenges. At the end of the year, we’ll assess where we are and go from there.”</p><p><b>Hullinger: Does he have to get to the playoffs to come back?</b></p><p><b>Blank: </b>“No. That was never really a requirement. The requirement was that we have a more competitive team this year. A winning team this year. I think that through this part of the season it’s been mixed quite honestly. I think that’s what the coach would say. Arthur is a very honest, very…….he looks at himself very critically. He comes from a beautiful family. Great values and he reflects those values in his leadership as best he can. We’ll see how the season plays out and go from there.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-falcons/falcons-benching-ridder-in-favor-of-heinicke-again/ZHEFXSSBPVE5ZG2LL62WXMCVME/">Falcons benching Ridder in favor of Heinecke - again</a></p><p><b>Hullinger: The quarterback situation has been tough this year.</b></p><p><b>Blank: </b>“It has been tough. We certainly had high hopes for Desmond Ridder. He’s done a lot of good things for us this year. He’d be the first to tell you that it he hasn’t been the kind of consistent performer that we’d like him to be. In this business, the NFL business or even if it was college ball, when you have turnovers it’s a very tough thing to overcome.”</p><p><b>Hullinger: “It’s a public business. You’ve got to please the fans.”</b></p><p><b>Blank: </b>“Well, you’ve got to please the fans. It is about pleasing the fans, but it is about really putting a product on the field that you know represents the best, the best of our roster and the best of what we can put together and in my case it’s having the best people that we can making the critical decisions. I don’t want to be in a position every year of having to pick players. I’ve never done that. I wouldn’t know how to do it. I’m like a fan in that regard. I have opinions, but so does….everybody else in Atlanta. But I think it’s really making sure we have the right people. Making sure they are fully empowered. Make sure they have all of the resources. Then making the decisions that they should make to put a winning product on the field. That’s their job.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Part of my <a href="https://twitter.com/mygpb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mygpb</a> interview, here is Falcons Owner Arthur Blank with me this Tuesday afternoon talking about Head Coach Arthur Smith, Desmond Ridder. <a href="https://t.co/68tq5KrtYM">https://t.co/68tq5KrtYM</a>… <a href="https://t.co/xLJOAZTDyR">pic.twitter.com/xLJOAZTDyR</a></p>&mdash; Jeff Hullinger (@jeff_hullinger1) <a href="https://twitter.com/jeff_hullinger1/status/1737248459013382486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2023</a></blockquote><h2><b>The Bow Tie Chronicles</b></h2><p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?p=CMGA4399572400" width="100%" height="482"></iframe></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>In a secure wing of the DeKalb County Sheriff’s Office at the edge of the agency’s monolithic jail facility, a group of children with incarcerated parents enjoyed a couple of hours of pure joy Tuesday despite their incongruous surroundings.</p><p>A total of 25 children from 13 families enjoyed lunch and, more importantly, generous gifts donated by employees of the sheriff’s office as part of the agency’s annual Adopt-A-Family event. Ranging in age from 4 to 13, each child was given a towering pile of meticulously wrapped gifts and allowed to open one on the spot. The rest would have to wait nearly a week until Christmas morning.</p><p>These were not stocking stuffers. They included Apple AirPods, bicycles, scooters and hoverboards. One little girl chose to open a present nearly twice as tall as her, revealing a 10-room dollhouse that would be more than 4½ feet tall and 6 feet wide when assembled.</p><p>Now in its 16th year, the Adopt-A-Family event is run, and mostly funded, by employees of the sheriff’s office. While the agency does accept donations for the event, DeKalb Sheriff Melody Maddox told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution it was a chance for her employees to give back to the community in a different way.</p><p>“These men and women went inside of their own pockets ... and purchased these gifts. This didn’t come out of the sheriff’s office budget; it didn’t come out of taxpayer dollars,” Maddox said to the crowd of foster families and employees gathered in the staff dining area. “That’s because we love and embrace our community.”</p><p>The beginning of the event was muted as families trickled in and Maddox and Chief Deputy Temetris Atkins gave speeches. Most of the crowd was made up of uniformed deputies and detention officers. But excitement began to grow among the children after lunch, donated by local Chick-fil-A and Honey Baked Ham franchises, as the kids took center stage one by one and began to open their presents.</p><p>The first few kids seemed trepidatious as Atkins directed them to pick out a single gift from their own individually labeled, overwhelmingly large piles. They gingerly tore into the wrapping paper, revealing LEGO sets, Ugg boots and an Easy Bake Oven.</p><p>As the magnitude of the gifts began to set in, each successive present was opened with more eagerness and excitement. Many gazed in awe at the gigantic sacks of presents that would be sent home with them.</p><p>The mastermind behind this holiday cheer is Carolina Mincey, a member of the administrative staff who helps plan and execute events for the sheriff’s office. She has directed the Adopt-A-Family event for 14 years and also runs a nonprofit called <a href="https://inspiringgreatnessinyou.org/" target="_blank">Inspiring Greatness in You</a>, which encourages girls to pursue interests in both golf and STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math).</p><p>Mincey said she thinks about the event year-round, but the real planning begins in October. She coordinates with local branches of Georgia’s Department of Human Services’ Division of Family and Children Services and Bethany Christian Services, both of which support children in foster care due to a parent’s incarceration. Each family can only be invited to the Adopt-A-Family event once, and it’s a boon to be selected. The joy on the faces of the children, their gasps of amazement as they opened their gifts and their twirls of celebration were proof of the event’s impact.</p><p>“Christmas is my favorite holiday,” Mincey said as she took a short break from directing the show. “I grew up as a kid having everything, so it just means a lot to me to be able to give other kids the opportunity to have everything.”</p><p>Asked about any memorable gifts or children’s reactions, Mincey said that TVs tend to get the biggest response.</p><p>“For a 7- or 8-year-old little kid, 32 inches is big to them,” Mincey said. “And one year, we did a dirt bike.”</p><p>This year, one of the most exciting gifts was a hoverboard/go-kart combo given to a boy who was also celebrating his birthday. Mincey said the boy was particularly excited to see another family at the event and she asked if they were his friends. It turned out the other kids were his siblings who had been placed in a separate foster home.</p><p>“They’re a united family joined today. So they’re having a great day,” Mincey said.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>]]>
